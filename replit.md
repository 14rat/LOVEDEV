# Romantic Sites MVP

## Overview

This is a Node.js + Express backend MVP for a romantic site creation service with dynamic subdomain hosting. The application allows users to create personalized romantic websites that are accessible through unique subdomains (e.g., `joao-maria.seudominio.com`). The system features a React frontend for the admin dashboard, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, Supabase authentication, and a template-based site generation system.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)

### Template Update and Published Site URL Fix (August 10, 2025)
**Successfully replaced old template with modern Index.html template and fixed critical URL routing issue:**

#### New Modern Template ✅
- **Complete Template Replacement**: Replaced old custom CSS template with modern TailwindCSS-based template from Index.html
- **Customizable Emoji Rain**: Added `rainEmoji` field to database schema and frontend forms, allowing users to customize falling emojis
- **Modern Design**: Dark theme with gradient text effects and responsive design using Tailwind Browser
- **Database Schema Update**: Added `rain_emoji` column with default value "❤️" and proper TypeScript types

#### Critical Bug Fix: Published Site URLs ✅
- **Root Cause**: Frontend URL generation was using hardcoded old Replit domain (66f1500d-11f2-4833-add4-9a9a2be970eb) instead of current domain (75bf169c-653b-444b-9120-f62906a6ea4a)
- **Impact**: Users clicking published site links saw "Run this app to see the results here" instead of their romantic sites
- **Solution**: Updated `getProjectUrl` functions in ProjectEditor.tsx and Home.tsx to use correct current Replit domain
- **Subdomain Routing**: Verified subdomain detection middleware correctly extracts slugs from URLs like `slug--replit-domain.dev`

#### Template Features Implemented
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with max-width containers
- **Customizable Content**: Title, subtitle, description, and image placement
- **Falling Animation**: Smooth emoji rain effect with sway motion and configurable emoji
- **Modern Typography**: Mozilla Text font family with gradient text effects
- **Error Handling**: Proper fallback content when images or data are missing

- **Published Sites**: Multiple test sites successfully deployed and accessible via unique subdomains

#### Technical Achievement
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL fully operational with all schema requirements
